# Hangman-Game

#### This is a simple application where the user will guess the robot's random word (Star Wars Theme). Once the user guesses the correct work, there will be an alert that says "You Win!". Else, you will get at alert that says "You Lose!". Base on your win/lose, the application will tally your score. You only have 20 guesses to begin with for each round. Once the alert pops up, there is a sound that plays when you win or lose. Have fun!
